# Development log

## 2026-09-25 — Project start through Milestone 0

**Environment.** Windows 11, i5-13500, 32 GB, Radeon RX 7800 XT. No C++
compiler, CMake, Qt or OCCT; no admin rights. Installed MSYS2 (base tarball
extracted into the user profile) and its UCRT64 packages: GCC 16.2, CMake
4.4.3, Ninja, Qt 6.11.2, OCCT 7.9.3, GTest, nlohmann-json, libzip. Upstream
OCCT is at 8.0.1; MSYS2 lags. Decision: build on 7.9.3, avoid deprecated APIs.

**Strict ISO mode hides `M_PI`.** OCCT headers use `M_PI`; with
`CMAKE_CXX_EXTENSIONS OFF` MinGW does not define it. Fixed with
`_USE_MATH_DEFINES` on the geometry target only.

**Push/pull via prism + boolean + unify.** Sweeping the face along its normal
(`BRepPrimAPI_MakePrism`), fusing or cutting, then
`ShapeUpgrade_UnifySameDomain` keeps a pushed box a clean 6-face box — tests
check face counts, not just volumes. A prism swept against the face normal is
inside-out; `BRepLib::OrientClosedSolid` fixes it before the cut.

**Picking on the CPU, not the GPU.** Decided to pick against our own
tessellation (ray/triangle for faces, projected segments for edges) instead of
an ID buffer. Makes picking testable headlessly and keeps ids ours. Hidden-edge
rejection uses a depth comparison against the visible face hit.

**Highlights as index ranges.** Tessellation emits each face's triangles
contiguously; storing per-face offsets lets the renderer draw a highlighted
face as a `drawIndexed` sub-range of the body's own index buffer: no per-hover
buffer rebuilds, scales to large meshes.

**QRhi headers moved.** In Qt 6.11 `rhi/qrhi.h` is only reachable through
`Qt6::GuiPrivate` (requested explicitly as a component). Accepted and
documented (ties us to the Qt minor version).

**Two-sided lighting without winding.** Backends differ in Y-flip, so
`gl_FrontFacing` is unreliable across D3D/Vulkan/GL; the shader flips the
view-space normal when `n.z < 0` instead.

**Visual verification from the command line.** `--demo <scene> --screenshot`
renders scripted states to PNG. First screenshots revealed an over-tight fit
(preview ran off screen), dark shading, and the value chip covering the arrow;
all fixed (fit margin 1.9, brighter ambient, chip placed beside the arrow tip).

**Real-input acceptance runner.** Direct controller calls could not verify
hover (Qt Quick re-sends synthetic hover events at the real cursor every
frame). `--acceptance` injects input through `QWindowSystemInterface` — the
path the platform plugin uses — so QML key handling and `Shortcut`s are tested
too. It immediately found a real bug: `StandardKey.Redo` already contains
Ctrl+Y on Windows, so listing "Ctrl+Y" as well made the shortcut *ambiguous*
and redo silently did nothing. Now 29/29 checks pass.

**CRLF pitfall.** Python edits on Windows wrote CRLF, which then made later
exact-match edits fail silently. Normalized the tree to LF (matches
`.gitattributes`); edit tools now used with explicit newline handling.

**`enable_testing()` order.** Tests registered from `src/app` were ignored
because `enable_testing()` ran after `add_subdirectory(src)`.
