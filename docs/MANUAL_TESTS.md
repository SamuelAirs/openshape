# Manual test pass

What the owner is asked to try by hand (last updated 2026-09-25). Anything
odd: a screenshot and a sentence is plenty. Starting the app with
`OPENSHAPE_LOG=debug` lets Claude read the log afterwards
(`%LOCALAPPDATA%\OpenShape\OpenShape\logs\openshape.log`).

## On Windows (the desktop shortcut)

1. **Sizes instead of distances.** Add a box, click its top face: the value
   box says "Height 20 mm" and a blue line shows what is measured. Drag the
   arrow (the number follows), type `35` + Enter, then `+5` and `-5`. Side
   faces say Width / Depth.
2. **Rounded edges come along.** Round the four top edges of a box (click an
   edge, Shift-click the others, type `3`, Enter). Click the top face, type
   a new height: the rounded edges should keep their size and move with the
   face — also when making it shorter, and with a chamfer instead.
3. **Sketch tools** (press K for a sketch):
   - Slot (O): click the two end centers, then move or type the width.
   - Trim (T): draw a rectangle and a line across it; point at the part of
     the line sticking out (it turns red) and click.
   - Round a corner: Select tool, click a rectangle corner, "Fillet"; click
     the R label to change the radius.
   - Offset: Shift-click the four sides of a rectangle, "Offset", move
     outside or inside, type `2`, Enter.
4. **Extrude options.** Click a sketch profile, then "Symmetric" and type
   `10` (5 mm each side); or "Up to face" and click the top of another body.
5. **Axes.** Blue Z axis through the origin and the X/Y/Z marker above the
   view buttons; orbit and watch the marker turn.
6. **About.** File → About OpenShape.
7. **Touch layout (optional).** Add ` --touch` after `OpenShape.exe` in the
   shortcut's Properties → Target: bigger buttons and a Pen switch.
8. **A real part.** Design something you need, export STL or 3MF, print it
   and measure: do sizes and hole diameters come out as typed?
